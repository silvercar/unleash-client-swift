This is the unofficial Swift client for Unleash. Read more about the [Unleash project](https://github.com/Unleash/unleash)
**Version 3.x of the client requires `unleash-server` >= v3.x**

## Installation
### Using [Carthage](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage)
Carthage is a decentralized dependency manager that builds your dependencies and provides you with binary frameworks.

You can install Carthage with [Homebrew](https://brew.sh) using the following command:
```
$ brew update
$ brew install carthage
```

To add the Unleash Swift Client into your Xcode project using Carthage, add the following to your `Cartfile`:
```
github "silvercar/unleash-client-swift" ~> 1.0 
```

Run `carthage update --platform ios` to build the framework and drag the built `Unleash.framework` into your Xcode project.

### Using [Cocoapods](https://cocoapods.org/)
CocoaPods is a dependency manager for Swift and Objective-C Cocoa projects. It has over 71 thousand libraries and is used in over 3 million apps. CocoaPods can help you scale your projects elegantly.

CocoaPods is built with Ruby and is installable with the default Ruby available on macOS. We recommend you use the default ruby.

Using the default Ruby install can require you to use sudo when installing gems. Further installation instructions are in the guides.

```
$ sudo gem install cocoapods
```

To add the Unleash Swift Client into your Xcode project using Cocoapods, add the following to your `Podfile`:
```
pod 'Unleash'
```

Run `pod install` to build a new workspace for your iOS project
